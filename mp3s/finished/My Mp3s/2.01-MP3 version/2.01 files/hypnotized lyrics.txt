Hypnotized lyrics
(c) 1986 Brian K. Vagnini


You do anything you're told
C1) 	When you're Hypnotized
	and you're not in control
	when you're Hypnotized
	and you're not in control

V1)	They can make you act like a chicken
	Stand on your head and recite Charles Dickens
	They can make you act like a fool
	when you jump into that swimming pool

C2)	When you're Hypnotized
	and you're not in control
	when you're Hypnotized
	and you're not in control
	You're Hypnotized
	You do anything you're told
	When you're Hypnotized
	and you're not in control

V2)	They can make you act like a Pig
	Make you put on a green and purple Wig!!
	They can make you into a Star
	but I doubt that you'll go very far
	They can take advantage of you 
	Make you look like a fool
	You will bend into their wishes
	and give out Free one dollar kisses

			C2)

V3)	They can make you think that you're drunk
	Make you act like a skunk
	and you'll go around all day
	Sayin' and shoutin' "Pardon Me!!"

			S)

			C2)
	Hypnotized
	and you're not in control
	When you're Hypnotized
	You do anything you're told
	When you're Hypnotized
	and you're not in control

	Hypnotized!!
