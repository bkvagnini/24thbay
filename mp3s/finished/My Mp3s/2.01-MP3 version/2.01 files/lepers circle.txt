	Leper's Circle
	by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 1988

(v1)	I passed you in the hall
	you didn't say "hi"
	used to be good friends and all
	and now I wonder why

(b)	we drifted apart
	don't know why
	tore my heart
	don't know why

(c)	Am I a part
	of the leper's circle?
	What did I do
	to deserve this?
	I tried everything
	I could
	Didn't even get a kiss

(v2)	passed you on the way to class
	stuck your nose in the air
	You really hurt my feelings, ya know
	like I wasn't even there
	don't know how you feel about me
	or how I feel 'bout you
	I can't tell what you mean to me
	my heart's like a zoo

(b)	we drifted apart
	don't know why
	tore my heart
	don't know why

(c)	Am I a part
	of the leper's circle?
	What did I do
	to deserve this?
	I tried everything
	I could
	Didn't even get a kiss

	(vocal scat-like solo)
