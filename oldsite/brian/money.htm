<b>"Money"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 1989</i><br>

<br>

(C)	People kll for it<br>

	and they'd die for it<br>

	They'd do anything for it<br>

	but it's only money<br>

<br>

(V)	From the President on down<br>

	to good ol Joe<br>

	Everybody wants it<br>

	but it's only money<br>

<br><br>

	(guitar solo)<br>

<br>

(B)	Addicted<br>

	that's what we are<br>

	no one else can<br>

	go so far<br>

	without money<br>

	money, money, money<br>

<br>

	(C)	<br>

<br>

(B)	Do we really need it <br>

	or is it immaterial<br>

	do we really want it that bad<br>

	all our lives surround it<br>

	and all we think about<br>

	is money, money, money<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

This song has no real special significance; it's just random thoughts about money and how some people place <i>too</i> much importance of the acquisition of it.  They say that love makes the world go 'round. I say that "Money makes the world go 'round, BUT love makes it a great place to hang out..."<br>   Sacrificing Love for Money is not a great thing to do, yet people do it all the time...Just my thoughts...
