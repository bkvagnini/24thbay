<b>"Eyes"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c)1989</i><br>

<br><br>



(I)<br>

<br>

(C)	Eyes<br>

	Windows to your soul<br>

	and to your mind<br>

		(when I look into your)<br>

	Eyes	<br>

	All of these messages<br>

	not disguised<br>

<br>

(V)	Speaking softly<br>

	and seductive<br>

	talking love<br>

	and friendship too<br>

	<br>

	different colors<br>

	different words<br>

	are spoken, me to you<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

<br>

	Eyes<br>

	<br><br>

	(S)<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

<br>

(V)	Speaking anger<br>

	piercing danger<br>

	if looks could kill<br>

	<br>

	what did I do<br>

	to deserve this<br>

	hatred by you?<br>

<br>

	(C) fade<br>

I have always felt that when you speak with someone, their eyes will tell a better story of what they feel than their actual words that they use....
