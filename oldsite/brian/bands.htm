Seville Quarter (Pensacola, FL), while waiting on a <a href="#magno">
friend's new band</a> to show up. I thought they were great and bought
their live CD on the spot. Two years later, "Hooch" is getting regular
airplay.&nbsp; Pretty cool. BTW, a friend of mine while I was on tour
with the <a
 href="http://www.armymwr.com/portal/recreation/entertainment/armysoldiershow/points.asp"
 target="_blank"> Army Soldier Show</a> mentioned a great college band
from Virginia. Turns out it was Everything. Pretty small world. Thanks

year was&nbsp; no exception. If you didn't catch them at Springfest
2000, you REALLY missed out on a great show!!</td>

      <td width="50%">Michael has been a good friend of mine for the
last 13 years or so, and has always supported what I was doing with my
music. He was one of the founding members of the last iteration of
Velvet Melon, a local band that played along the Gulf Coast for about
seven years. The remaining members of Velvet Melon renamed the band to
"the Melons" after Jay Young died. Michael took over lead vocals while
still playing keys. Several years later, "Blue Sky Salesmen" was born,
ironically out of former members of Velvet Melon. They have put out two
CDs to date that I am aware of, while Michael has put out one or two
solo CDs. He moved to Atlanta to pursue a solo career, and is doing
well. He sings, plays guitar, keys, saxophone, and I'm not sure what
else he plays.</td>
