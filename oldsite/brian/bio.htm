  <p>I have been playing music since 1986, 
    when I learned to play the saxophone. I had to take a semester long course 
    in music appreciation or something like that. It was one of those courses 
    in high school where everyone had to take it at some point and where you learned 
    to play the soprano recorder ( you know...the flute thingy made of plastic 
    that sounded horrible if you blew into it too loud). Well, Mrs. Gibson, the 
    chorus teacher, was teaching the class and noticed that I was pretty good 
    at it. She asked me if I had thought about being in the band. I told her that 
    sounded like a pretty good idea. We went and talked to the band director, 
    who had office hours at that time of day. He agreed to teach me how to play 
    the alto saxophone during that period, so I wouldn't have to adjust my schedule 
    at all. The following summer, I learned how to march.</p>
  <p>At about the same time, I also taught myself how to play the piano (with 
    help from my mom and Joey Allred, a friend of mine). My mom had always had 
    a piano in the house, so I tinkered with it. I imagine that it drove her crazy. 
    See, I would get an idea, then I would play it over and over...and over....and 
    over.... and over.....and over again....until I thought of something else 
    to go with it. At that point, I would have to try out how the new idea linked 
    to the old one, so I would play them both...again ....and again...and again....and 
    again. ( You get the idea....). I finally bought a keyboard, a Roland synthesizer 
    (well, my mom put it on her credit card, but I paid her back). The deal was 
    that I give her $40 a week until it was paid for. I think it cost $1100 or 
    something like that, so this was something that was going to take a while 
    to pay off, especially at 16 years old. I was working at Delchamps at the 
    time and there were some weeks where I paid Mom $40 and put $10 in gas into 
    my car, which wouldn't have been so bad, except that that week I took home 
    a whopping $53. Yeah, a whole $3 to spend on myself for the week. I'll try 
    not to spend it all in one place. It was pretty cool, though. I had both the 
    keyboard and the piano to play at the same time. </p>
  <p>The following year, I signed up for Jazz band, initially playing alto saxophone. 
    Midway through the course, the bass player had quit, electing to enroll at 
    PJC as a dual enrollment student. That left an opening for bass. At that point, 
    I was getting tired of playing the sax, so I volunteered for the bass slot. 
    There were two problems though; one, I didn't know how to play the bass and 
    two, I didn't have a bass. I initially didn't own a bass, but I wanted to 
    learn. I talked to an assistant manager at Delchamps (where I was working 
    at the time) and he had a bass; furthermore, it was for sale, as his wife 
    was pregnant with their first child and they needed both the money and the 
    space. I think he let me have the bass, case and amplifier for the grand sum 
    of $150. The amp was old, the bass even older. I believe it was a Gibson Epiphone 
    and the thing was <strong>HEAVY!</strong> But it served its purpose; I learned 
    how to play. Not that that was any easy task; I had to now learn bass clef 
    in addition to treble clef for the saxophone for concert band/jazz band. Initially, 
    I was confusing the two clefs, which wasn't a big problem in concert band 
    (made some nice harmonies a third up), but <strong> BOY </strong> , did it 
    mess things up in Jazz band!! After about two weeks or so, I managed to straighten 
    it all out in my head. Once the music bug bit me though, I had to work on 
    more. I signed up for a percussion class, mostly learning the snare drum (rudiments 
    and stuff like that). It was OK, but I was hoping to learn more complicated 
    rhythms to augment my bass playing.</p>
  <p>By the end of the year, I was working on four different instruments, in four 
    different bands. It was a sheer miracle that I even graduated High School. 
    (Looking back at those transcripts, I failed classes that I don't even remember 
    taking...could be <i>why</i> I failed those classes.) However, I was having 
    a grand old time, playing in Concert band, the In School Jazz Band, the after 
    school jazz band, a rock band called "Bad Habit" (playing keyboards) AND an 
    all original band called "24thBay" with some friends of mine. My career was 
    off to a good start...</p>
  <p>Five weeks of summer vacation and then I went to hell, otherwise referred 
    to as Basic Training. I had decided that I would join the Army. Basic training 
    put a great deal of stress on me, and I wrote a TON of music during that two 
    month period. After Basic Training came AIT or Advanced Individual Training 
    (where you learn how to do your specific job). There was a bit more freedom 
    there, than in Basic Training. I spent a great deal of time in the recreation 
    center, working on music and continuing to write songs. The stress level was 
    diminishing, but still more than what normal people deal with in the civilian 
    world. Shortly before leaving Fort Gortdon, GA (where AIT was held), I had 
    orders for South Korea. I had NO desire to go at all, and thought that the 
    <a href= "http://www.armymwr.com/portal/recreation/entertainment/armysoldiershow/points.asp" target="_blank">All 
    Army Soldier Show </a>would be my answer. I had heard about it while in the 
    rec center and went to audition, only to discover that the auditions were 
    over. I swore that before I left the Army, I would go on tour with them. Almost 
    three years later, I did. <i>More to come on the musical bio...</i></p>
