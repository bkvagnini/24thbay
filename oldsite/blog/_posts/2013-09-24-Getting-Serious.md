Getting serious about the new album
-----------------------------------

I've created a production template that I will be using as a tool to stay on track and also to maintain focus. I borrowed the idea from the [Foo Fighters][foo] Back and Forth DVD, only they did it with a dry erase board. I'm taking the modern approach and doing it in [Google Docs][google].
