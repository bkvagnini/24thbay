  <p><strong>The controversial singer takes on record label profits, Napster and 
    &quot;sucka VCs.&quot;</strong></p>
  <h5>By Courtney Love </h5>

  June 14, 2000 | Today I want to talk about piracy and music. What is piracy? 
  Piracy is the act of stealing an artist's work without any intention of paying 
  for it. I'm not talking about Napster-type software. <br />
  I'm talking about major label recording contracts. <br />
  I want to start with a story about rock bands and record companies, and do some 
  recording-contract math: <br />
  This story is about a bidding-war band that gets a huge deal with a 20 percent 
  royalty rate and a million-dollar advance. (No bidding-war band ever got a 20 
  percent royalty, but whatever.) This is my &quot;funny&quot; math based on some 
  reality and I just want to qualify it by saying I'm positive it's better math 
  than what Edgar Bronfman Jr. [the president and CEO of Seagram, which owns Polygram] 
  would provide. <br />
  What happens to that million dollars? <br />
  They spend half a million to record their album. That leaves the band with $500,000. 
  They pay $100,000 to their manager for 20 percent commission. They pay $25,000 
  each to their lawyer and business manager. <br />
  That leaves $350,000 for the four band members to split. After $170,000 in taxes, 
  there's $180,000 left. That comes out to $45,000 per person. <br />
  That's $45,000 to live on for a year until the record gets released. <br />
  The record is a big hit and sells a million copies. (How a bidding-war band 
  sells a million copies of its debut record is another rant entirely, but it's 
  based on any basic civics-class knowledge that any of us have about cartels. 
  Put simply, the antitrust laws in this country are basically a joke, protecting 
  us just enough to not have to re-name our park service the Phillip Morris National 
  Park Service.) <br />
  So, this band releases two singles and makes two videos. The two videos cost 
  a million dollars to make and 50 percent of the video production costs are recouped 
  out of the band's royalties. <br />
  The band gets $200,000 in tour support, which is 100 percent recoupable. <br />
  The record company spends $300,000 on independent radio promotion. You have 
  to pay independent promotion to get your song on the radio; independent promotion 
  is a system where the record companies use middlemen so they can pretend not 
  to know that radio stations -- the unified broadcast system -- are getting paid 
  to play their records. <br />
  All of those independent promotion costs are charged to the band. <br />
  Since the original million-dollar advance is also recoupable, the band owes 
  $2 million to the record company. <br />
  If all of the million records are sold at full price with no discounts or record 
  clubs, the band earns $2 million in royalties, since their 20 percent royalty 
  works out to $2 a record. <br />
  Two million dollars in royalties minus $2 million in recoupable expenses equals 
  ... zero! <br />
  How much does the record company make? <br />
  They grossed $11 million. <br />
  It costs $500,000 to manufacture the CDs and they advanced the band $1 million. 
  Plus there were $1 million in video costs, $300,000 in radio promotion and $200,000 
  in tour support. <br />
  The company also paid $750,000 in music publishing royalties. <br />
  They spent $2.2 million on marketing. That's mostly retail advertising, but 
  marketing also pays for those huge posters of Marilyn Manson in Times Square 
  and the street scouts who drive around in vans handing out black Korn T-shirts 
  and backwards baseball caps. Not to mention trips to Scores and cash for tips 
  for all and sundry. <br />
  Add it up and the record company has spent about $4.4 million. <br />
  So their profit is $6.6 million; the band may as well be working at a 7-Eleven. 
  <br />
  Of course, they had fun. Hearing yourself on the radio, selling records, getting 
  new fans and being on TV is great, but now the band doesn't have enough money 
  to pay the rent and nobody has any credit. <br />
  Worst of all, after all this, the band owns none of its work ... they can pay 
  the mortgage forever but they'll never own the house. Like I said: Sharecropping. 
  Our media says, &quot;Boo hoo, poor pop stars, they had a nice ride. Fuck them 
  for speaking up&quot;; but I say this dialogue is imperative. And cynical media 
  people, who are more fascinated with celebrity than most celebrities, need to 
  reacquaint themselves with their value systems. <br />
  When you look at the legal line on a CD, it says copyright 1976 Atlantic Records 
  or copyright 1996 RCA Records. When you look at a book, though, it'll say something 
  like copyright 1999 Susan Faludi, or David Foster Wallace. Authors own their 
  books and license them to publishers. When the contract runs out, writers gets 
  their books back. But record companies own our copyrights forever. <br />
  The system's set up so almost nobody gets paid. <br />
  Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) <br />
  Last November, a Congressional aide named Mitch Glazier, with the support of 
  the RIAA, added a &quot;technical amendment&quot; to a bill that defined recorded 
  music as &quot;works for hire&quot; under the 1978 Copyright Act. <br />
  He did this after all the hearings on the bill were over. By the time artists 
  found out about the change, it was too late. The bill was on its way to the 
  White House for the president's signature. <br />
  That subtle change in copyright law will add billions of dollars to record company 
  bank accounts over the next few years -- billions of dollars that rightfully 
  should have been paid to artists. A &quot;work for hire&quot; is now owned in 
  perpetuity by the record company. <br />
  Under the 1978 Copyright Act, artists could reclaim the copyrights on their 
  work after 35 years. If you wrote and recorded &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; 
  you at least got it back to as a family legacy after 35 years. But now, because 
  of this corrupt little pisher, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; never gets returned 
  to your family, and can now be sold to the highest bidder. <br />
  Over the years record companies have tried to put &quot;work for hire&quot; 
  provisions in their contracts, and Mr. Glazier claims that the &quot;work for 
  hire&quot; only &quot;codified&quot; a standard industry practice. But copyright 
  laws didn't identify sound recordings as being eligible to be called &quot;works 
  for hire,&quot; so those contracts didn't mean anything. Until now. <br />
  Writing and recording &quot;Hey Jude&quot; is now the same thing as writing 
  an English textbook, writing standardized tests, translating a novel from one 
  language to another or making a map. These are the types of things addressed 
  in the &quot;work for hire&quot; act. And writing a standardized test is a work 
  for hire. Not making a record. <br />
  So an assistant substantially altered a major law when he only had the authority 
  to make spelling corrections. That's not what I learned about how government 
  works in my high school civics class. <br />
  Three months later, the RIAA hired Mr. Glazier to become its top lobbyist at 
  a salary that was obviously much greater than the one he had as the spelling 
  corrector guy. <br />
  The RIAA tries to argue that this change was necessary because of a provision 
  in the bill that musicians supported. That provision prevents anyone from registering 
  a famous person's name as a Web address without that person's permission. That's 
  great. I own my name, and should be able to do what I want with my name. <br />
  But the bill also created an exception that allows a company to take a person's 
  name for a Web address if they create a work for hire. Which means a record 
  company would be allowed to own your Web site when you record your &quot;work 
  for hire&quot; album. Like I said: Sharecropping. <br />
  Although I've never met any one at a record company who &quot;believed in the 
  Internet,&quot; they've all been trying to cover their asses by securing everyone's 
  digital rights. Not that they know what to do with them. Go to a major label-owned 
  band site. Give me a dollar for every time you see an annoying &quot;under construction&quot; 
  sign. I used to pester Geffen (when it was a label) to do a better job. I was 
  totally ignored for two years, until I got my band name back. The Goo Goo Dolls 
  are struggling to gain control of their domain name from Warner Bros., who claim 
  they own the name because they set up a shitty promotional Web site for the 
  band. <br />
  Orrin Hatch, songwriter and Republican senator from Utah, seems to be the only 
  person in Washington with a progressive view of copyright law. One lobbyist 
  says that there's no one in the House with a similar view and that &quot;this 
  would have never happened if Sonny Bono was still alive.&quot; <br />
  By the way, which bill do you think the recording industry used for this amendment? 
  <br />
  The Record Company Redefinition Act? No. The Music Copyright Act? No. The Work 
  for Hire Authorship Act? No. <br />
  How about the Satellite Home Viewing Act of 1999? <br />
  Stealing our copyright reversions in the dead of night while no one was looking, 
  and with no hearings held, is piracy. <br />
  It's piracy when the RIAA lobbies to change the bankruptcy law to make it more 
  difficult for musicians to declare bankruptcy. Some musicians have declared 
  bankruptcy to free themselves from truly evil contracts. TLC declared bankruptcy 
  after they received less than 2 percent of the $175 million earned by their 
  CD sales. That was about 40 times less than the profit that was divided among 
  their management, production and record companies. <br />
  Toni Braxton also declared bankruptcy in 1998. She sold $188 million worth of 
  CDs, but she was broke because of a terrible recording contract that paid her 
  less than 35 cents per album. Bankruptcy can be an artist's only defense against 
  a truly horrible deal and the RIAA wants to take it away. <br />
  Artists want to believe that we can make lots of money if we're successful. 
  But there are hundreds of stories about artists in their 60s and 70s who are 
  broke because they never made a dime from their hit records. And real success 
  is still a long shot for a new artist today. Of the 32,000 new releases each 
  year, only 250 sell more than 10,000 copies. And less than 30 go platinum. <br />
  The four major record corporations fund the RIAA. These companies are rich and 
  obviously well-represented. Recording artists and musicians don't really have 
  the money to compete. The 273,000 working musicians in America make about $30,000 
  a year. Only 15 percent of American Federation of Musicians members work steadily 
  in music. <br />
  But the music industry is a $40 billion-a-year business. One-third of that revenue 
  comes from the United States. The annual sales of cassettes, CDs and video are 
  larger than the gross national product of 80 countries. Americans have more 
  CD players, radios and VCRs than we have bathtubs. <br />
  Story after story gets told about artists -- some of them in their 60s and 70s, 
  some of them authors of huge successful songs that we all enjoy, use and sing 
  -- living in total poverty, never having been paid anything. Not even having 
  access to a union or to basic health care. Artists who have generated billions 
  of dollars for an industry die broke and un-cared for. <br />
  And they're not actors or participators. They're the rightful owners, originators 
  and performers of original compositions. <br />
  This is piracy. <br />
  Technology is not piracy <br />
  This opinion is one I really haven't formed yet, so as I speak about Napster 
  now, please understand that I'm not totally informed. I will be the first in 
  line to file a class action suit to protect my copyrights if Napster or even 
  the far more advanced Gnutella doesn't work with us to protect us. I'm on [Metallica 
  drummer] Lars Ulrich's side, in other words, and I feel really badly for him 
  that he doesn't know how to condense his case down to a sound-bite that sounds 
  more reasonable than the one I saw today. <br />
  I also think Metallica is being given too much grief. It's anti-artist, for 
  one thing. An artist speaks up and the artist gets squashed: Sharecropping. 
  Don't get above your station, kid. It's not piracy when kids swap music over 
  the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or Freenet or iMesh or beaming their 
  CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys 
  that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads 
  so that they can be &quot;the labels' friend,&quot; and not the artists'. <br />
  Recording artists have essentially been giving their music away for free under 
  the old system, so new technology that exposes our music to a larger audience 
  can only be a good thing. Why aren't these companies working with us to create 
  some peace? <br />
  There were a billion music downloads last year, but music sales are up. Where's 
  the evidence that downloads hurt business? Downloads are creating more demand. 
  <br />
  Why aren't record companies embracing this great opportunity? Why aren't they 
  trying to talk to the kids passing compilations around to learn what they like? 
  Why is the RIAA suing the companies that are stimulating this new demand? What's 
  the point of going after people swapping cruddy-sounding MP3s? Cash! Cash they 
  have no intention of passing onto us, the writers of their profits. <br />
  At this point the &quot;record collector&quot; geniuses who use Napster don't 
  have the coolest most arcane selection anyway, unless you're into techno. Hardly 
  any pre-1982 REM fans, no '60s punk, even the Alan Parsons Project was underrepresented 
  when I tried to find some Napster buddies. For the most part, it was college 
  boy rawk without a lot of imagination. Maybe that's the demographic that cares 
  -- and in that case, My Bloody Valentine and Bert Jansch aren't going to get 
  screwed just yet. There's still time to negotiate. <br />
  Destroying traditional access <br />
  Somewhere along the way, record companies figured out that it's a lot more profitable 
  to control the distribution system than it is to nurture artists. And since 
  the companies didn't have any real competition, artists had no other place to 
  go. Record companies controlled the promotion and marketing; only they had the 
  ability to get lots of radio play, and get records into all the big chain store. 
  That power put them above both the artists and the audience. They own the plantation. 
  <br />
  Being the gatekeeper was the most profitable place to be, but now we're in a 
  world half without gates. The Internet allows artists to communicate directly 
  with their audiences; we don't have to depend solely on an inefficient system 
  where the record company promotes our records to radio, press or retail and 
  then sits back and hopes fans find out about our music. <br />
  Record companies don't understand the intimacy between artists and their fans. 
  They put records on the radio and buy some advertising and hope for the best. 
  Digital distribution gives everyone worldwide, instant access to music. <br />
  And filters are replacing gatekeepers. In a world where we can get anything 
  we want, whenever we want it, how does a company create value? By filtering. 
  In a world without friction, the only friction people value is editing. A filter 
  is valuable when it understands the needs of both artists and the public. New 
  companies should be conduits between musicians and their fans. <br />
  Right now the only way you can get music is by shelling out $17. In a world 
  where music costs a nickel, an artist can &quot;sell&quot; 100 million copies 
  instead of just a million. <br />
  The present system keeps artists from finding an audience because it has too 
  many artificial scarcities: limited radio promotion, limited bin space in stores 
  and a limited number of spots on the record company roster. <br />
  The digital world has no scarcities. There are countless ways to reach an audience. 
  Radio is no longer the only place to hear a new song. And tiny mall record stores 
  aren't the only place to buy a new CD. <br />
  I'm leaving <br />
  Now artists have options. We don't have to work with major labels anymore, because 
  the digital economy is creating new ways to distribute and market music. And 
  the free ones amongst us aren't going to. That means the slave class, which 
  I represent, has to find ways to get out of our deals. This didn't really matter 
  before, and that's why we all stayed. <br />
  I want my seven-year contract law California labor code case to mean something 
  to other artists. (Universal Records sues me because I leave because my employment 
  is up, but they say a recording contract is not a personal contract; because 
  the recording industry -- who, we have established, are excellent lobbyists, 
  getting, as they did, a clerk to disallow Don Henley or Tom Petty the right 
  to give their copyrights to their families -- in California, in 1987, lobbied 
  to pass an amendment that nullified recording contracts as personal contracts, 
  sort of. Maybe. Kind of. A little bit. And again, in the dead of night, succeeded.) 
  <br />
  That's why I'm willing to do it with a sword in my teeth. I expect I'll be ignored 
  or ostracized following this lawsuit. I expect that the treatment you're seeing 
  Lars Ulrich get now will quadruple for me. Cool. At least I'll serve a purpose. 
  I'm an artist and a good artist, I think, but I'm not that artist that has to 
  play all the time, and thus has to get fucked. Maybe my laziness and self-destructive 
  streak will finally pay off and serve a community desperately in need of it. 
  They can't torture me like they could Lucinda Williams. <br />
  You funny dot-communists. Get your shit together, you annoying sucka VCs <br />
  I want to work with people who believe in music and art and passion. And I'm 
  just the tip of the iceberg. I'm leaving the major label system and there are 
  hundreds of artists who are going to follow me. There's an unbelievable opportunity 
  for new companies that dare to get it right. <br />
  How can anyone defend the current system when it fails to deliver music to so 
  many potential fans? That only expects of itself a &quot;5 percent success rate&quot; 
  a year? The status quo gives us a boring culture. In a society of over 300 million 
  people, only 30 new artists a year sell a million records. By any measure, that's 
  a huge failure. <br />
  Maybe each fan will spend less money, but maybe each artist will have a better 
  chance of making a living. Maybe our culture will get more interesting than 
  the one currently owned by Time Warner. I'm not crazy. Ask yourself, are any 
  of you somehow connected to Time Warner media? I think there are a lot of yeses 
  to that and I'd have to say that in that case president McKinley truly failed 
  to bust any trusts. Maybe we can remedy that now. <br />
  Artists will make that compromise if it means we can connect with hundreds of 
  millions of fans instead of the hundreds of thousands that we have now. Especially 
  if we lose all the crap that goes with success under the current system. I'm 
  willing, right now, to leave half of these trappings -- fuck it, all these trappings 
  -- at the door to have a pure artist experience. They cosset us with trappings 
  to shut us up. That way when we say &quot;sharecropper!&quot; you can point 
  to my free suit and say &quot;Shut up pop star.&quot; <br />
  Here, take my Prada pants. Fuck it. Let us do our real jobs. And those of us 
  addicted to celebrity because we have nothing else to give will fade away. And 
  those of us addicted to celebrity because it was there will find a better, purer 
  way to live. <br />
  Since I've basically been giving my music away for free under the old system, 
  I'm not afraid of wireless, MP3 files or any of the other threats to my copyrights. 
  Anything that makes my music more available to more people is great. MP3 files 
  sound cruddy, but a well-made album sounds great. And I don't care what anyone 
  says about digital recordings. At this point they are good for dance music, 
  but try listening to a warm guitar tone on them. They suck for what I do. <br />
  Record companies are terrified of anything that challenges their control of 
  distribution. This is the business that insisted that CDs be sold in incredibly 
  wasteful 6-by-12 inch long boxes just because no one thought you could change 
  the bins in a record store. <br />
  Let's not call the major labels &quot;labels.&quot; Let's call them by their 
  real names: They are the distributors. They're the only distributors and they 
  exist because of scarcity. Artists pay 95 percent of whatever we make to gatekeepers 
  because we used to need gatekeepers to get our music heard. Because they have 
  a system, and when they decide to spend enough money -- all of it recoupable, 
  all of it owed by me -- they can occasionally shove things through this system, 
  depending on a lot of arbitrary factors. <br />
  The corporate filtering system, which is the system that brought you (in my 
  humble opinion) a piece of crap like &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; and didn't let 
  you hear the brilliant Cat Power record or the amazing new Sleater Kinney record, 
  obviously doesn't have good taste anyway. But we've never paid major label/distributors 
  for their good taste. They've never been like Yahoo and provided a filter service. 
  <br />
  There were a lot of factors that made a distributor decide to push a recording 
  through the system: <br />
  How powerful is management? <br />
  Who owes whom a favor? <br />
  What independent promoter's cousin is the drummer? <br />
  What part of the fiscal year is the company putting out the record? <br />
  Is the royalty rate for the artist so obscenely bad that it's almost 100 percent 
  profit instead of just 95 percent so that if the record sells, it's literally 
  a steal? <br />
  How much bin space is left over this year? <br />
  Was the record already a hit in Europe so that there's corporate pressure to 
  make it work? <br />
  Will the band screw up its live career to play free shows for radio stations? 
  <br />
  Does the artist's song sound enough like someone else that radio stations will 
  play it because it fits the sound of the month? <br />
  Did the artist get the song on a film soundtrack so that the movie studio will 
  pay for the video? <br />
  These factors affect the decisions that go into the system. Not public taste. 
  All these things are becoming eradicated now. They are gone or on their way 
  out. We don't need the gatekeepers any more. We just don't need them. <br />
  And if they aren't going to do for me what I can do for myself with my 19-year-old 
  Webmistress on my own Web site, then they need to get the hell out of my way. 
  [I will] allow millions of people to get my music for nothing if they want and 
  hopefully they'll be kind enough to leave a tip if they like it. <br />
  I still need the old stuff. I still need a producer in the creation of a recording, 
  I still need to get on the radio (which costs a lot of money), I still need 
  bin space for hardware CDs, I still need to provide an opportunity for people 
  without computers to buy the hardware that I make. I still need a lot of this 
  stuff, but I can get these things from a joint venture with a company that serves 
  as a conduit and knows its place. Serving the artist and serving the public: 
  That's its place. <br />
  Equity for artists <br />
  A new company that gives artists true equity in their work can take over the 
  world, kick ass and make a lot of money. We're inspired by how people get paid 
  in the new economy. Many visual artists and software and hardware designers 
  have real ownership of their work. <br />
  I have a 14-year-old niece. She used to want to be a rock star. Before that 
  she wanted to be an actress. As of six months ago, what do you think she wants 
  to be when she grows up? What's the glamorous, emancipating career of choice? 
  Of course, she wants to be a Web designer. It's such a glamorous business! <br />
  When you people do business with artists, you have to take a different view 
  of things. We want to be treated with the respect that now goes to Web designers. 
  We're not Dockers-wearing Intel workers from Portland who know how to &quot;manage 
  our stress.&quot; We don't understand or want to understand corporate culture. 
  <br />
  I feel this obscene gold rush greedgreedgreed vibe that bothers me a lot when 
  I talk to dot-com people about all this. You guys can't hustle artists that 
  well. At least slick A&amp;R guys know the buzzwords. Don't try to compete with 
  them. I just laugh at you when you do! Maybe you could a year ago when anything 
  dot-com sounded smarter than the rest of us, but the scam has been uncovered. 
  <br />
  The celebrity-for-sale business is about to crash, I hope, and the idea of a 
  sucker VC gifting some company with four floors just because they can &quot;do&quot; 
  &quot;chats&quot; with &quot;Christina&quot; once or twice is ridiculous. I 
  did a chat today, twice. Big damn deal. 200 bucks for the software and some 
  elbow grease and a good back-end coder. Wow. That's not worth 150 million bucks. 
  <br />
  ... I mean, yeah, sure it is if you'd like to give it to me. <br />
  Tipping/music as service <br />
  I know my place. I'm a waiter. I'm in the service industry. <br />
  I live on tips. Occasionally, I'm going to get stiffed, but that's OK. If I 
  work hard and I'm doing good work, I believe that the people who enjoy it are 
  going to want to come directly to me and get my music because it sounds better, 
  since it's mastered and packaged by me personally. I'm providing an honest, 
  real experience. Period. <br />
  When people buy the bootleg T-shirt in the concert parking lot and not the more 
  expensive T-shirt inside the venue, it isn't to save money. The T-shirt in the 
  parking lot is cheap and badly made, but it's easier to buy. The bootleggers 
  have a better distribution system. There's no waiting in line and it only takes 
  two minutes to buy one. <br />
  I know that if I can provide my own T-shirt that I designed, that I made, and 
  provide it as quickly or quicker than the bootleggers, people who've enjoyed 
  the experience I've provided will be happy to shell out a little more money 
  to cover my costs. Especially if they understand this context, and aren't being 
  shoveled a load of shit about &quot;uppity&quot; artists. <br />
  It's exactly the same with recorded music. The real thing to fear from Napster 
  is its simple and excellent distribution system. No one really prefers a cruddy-sounding 
  Napster MP3 file to the real thing. But it's really easy to get an MP3 file; 
  and in the middle of Kansas you may never see my record because major distribution 
  is really bad if your record's not in the charts this week, and even then it 
  takes a couple of weeks to restock the one copy they usually keep on hand. <br />
  I also know how many times I have heard a song on the radio that I loved only 
  to buy the record and have the album be a piece of crap. If you're afraid of 
  your own filler then I bet you're afraid of Napster. I'm afraid of Napster because 
  I think the major label cartel will get to them before I do. <br />
  I've made three records. I like them all. I haven't made filler and they're 
  all committed pieces of work. I'm not scared of you previewing my record. If 
  you like it enough to have it be a part of your life, I know you'll come to 
  me to get it, as long as I show you how to get to me, and as long as you know 
  that it's out. <br />
  Most people don't go into restaurants and stiff waiters, but record labels represent 
  the restaurant that forces the waiters to live on, and sometimes pool, their 
  tips. And they even fight for a bit of their tips. <br />
  Music is a service to its consumers, not a product. I live on tips. Giving music 
  away for free is what artists have been doing naturally all their lives. <br />
  New models <br />
  Record companies stand between artists and their fans. We signed terrible deals 
  with them because they controlled our access to the public. <br />
  But in a world of total connectivity, record companies lose that control. With 
  unlimited bin space and intelligent search engines, fans will have no trouble 
  finding the music they know they want. They have to know they want it, and that 
  needs to be a marketing business that takes a fee. <br />
  If a record company has a reason to exist, it has to bring an artist's music 
  to more fans and it has to deliver more and better music to the audience. You 
  bring me a bigger audience or a better relationship with my audience or get 
  the fuck out of my way. Next time I release a record, I'll be able to go directly 
  to my fans and let them hear it before anyone else. <br />
  We'll still have to use radio and traditional CD distribution. Record stores 
  aren't going away any time soon and radio is still the most important part of 
  record promotion. <br />
  Major labels are freaking out because they have no control in this new world. 
  Artists can sell CDs directly to fans. We can make direct deals with thousands 
  of other Web sites and promote our music to millions of people that old record 
  companies never touch. <br />
  We're about to have lots of new ways to sell our music: downloads, hardware 
  bundles, memory sticks, live Webcasts, and lots of other things that aren't 
  even invented yet. <br />
  Content providers <br />
  But there's something you guys have to figure out. <br />
  Here's my open letter to Steve Case: <br />
  Avatars don't talk back!!! But what are you going to do with real live artists? 
  <br />
  Artists aren't like you. We go through a creative process that's demented and 
  crazy. There's a lot of soul-searching and turning ourselves inside-out and 
  all kinds of gross stuff that ends up on &quot;Behind the Music.&quot; <br />
  A lot of people who haven't been around artists very much get really weird when 
  they sit down to lunch with us. So I want to give you some advice: Learn to 
  speak our language. Talk about songs and melody and hooks and art and beauty 
  and soul. Not sleazy record-guy crap, where you're in a cashmere sweater murmuring 
  that the perfect deal really is perfect, Courtney. Yuck. Honestly hire honestly 
  committed people. We're in a &quot;new economy,&quot; right? You can afford 
  to do that. <br />
  But don't talk to me about &quot;content.&quot; <br />
  I get really freaked out when I meet someone and they start telling me that 
  I should record 34 songs in the next six months so that we have enough content 
  for my site. Defining artistic expression as content is anathema to me. <br />
  What the hell is content? Nobody buys content. Real people pay money for music 
  because it means something to them. A great song is not just something to take 
  up space on a Web site next to stock market quotes and baseball scores. <br />
  DEN tried to build a site with artist-free content and I'm not sorry to see 
  it fail. The DEN shows look like art if you're not paying attention, but they 
  forgot to hire anyone to be creative. So they ended up with a lot of content 
  nobody wants to see because they thought they could avoid dealing with defiant 
  and moody personalities. Because they were arrogant. And because they were conformists. 
  Artists have to deal with business people and business people have to deal with 
  artists. We hate each other. Let's create companies of mediators. <br />
  Every single artist who makes records believes and hopes that they give you 
  something that will transform your life. If you're really just interested in 
  data mining or selling banner ads, stick with those &quot;artists&quot; willing 
  to call themselves content providers. <br />
  I don't know if an artist can last by meeting the current public taste, the 
  taste from the last quarterly report. I don't think you can last by following 
  demographics and carefully meeting expectations. I don't know many lasting works 
  of art that are condescending or deliberately stupid or were created as content. 
  <br />
  Don't tell me I'm a brand. I'm famous and people recognize me, but I can't look 
  in the mirror and see my brand identity. <br />
  Keep talking about brands and you know what you'll get? Bad clothes. Bad hair. 
  Bad books. Bad movies. And bad records. And bankrupt businesses. Rides that 
  were fun for a year with no employee loyalty but everyone got rich fucking you. 
  Who wants that? The answer is purity. We can afford it. Let's go find it again 
  while we can. <br />
  I also feel filthy trying to call my music a product. It's not a thing that 
  I test market like toothpaste or a new car. Music is personal and mysterious. 
  <br />
  Being a &quot;content provider&quot; is prostitution work that devalues our 
  art and doesn't satisfy our spirits. Artistic expression has to be provocative. 
  The problem with artists and the Internet: Once their art is reduced to content, 
  they may never have the opportunity to retrieve their souls. <br />
  When you form your business for creative people, with creative people, come 
  at us with some thought. Everybody's process is different. And remember that 
  it's art. We're not craftspeople. <br />
  Sponsorships <br />
  I don't know what a good sponsorship would be for me or for other artists I 
  respect. People bring up sponsorships a lot as a way for artists to get our 
  music paid for upfront and for us to earn a fee. I've dealt with large corporations 
  for long enough to know that any alliance where I'm an owned service is going 
  to be doomed. <br />
  When I agreed to allow a large cola company to promote a live show, I couldn't 
  have been more miserable. They screwed up every single thing imaginable. The 
  venue was empty but sold out. There were thousands of people outside who wanted 
  to be there, trying to get tickets. And there were the empty seats the company 
  had purchased for a lump sum and failed to market because they were clueless 
  about music. <br />
  It was really dumb. You had to buy the cola. You had to dial a number. You had 
  to press a bunch of buttons. You had to do all this crap that nobody wanted 
  to do. Why not just bring a can to the door? <br />
  On top of all this, I felt embarrassed to be an advertising agent for a product 
  that I'd never let my daughter use. Plus they were a condescending bunch of 
  little guys. They treated me like I was an ungrateful little bitch who should 
  be groveling for the experience to play for their damn soda. <br />
  I ended up playing without my shirt on and ordering a six-pack of the rival 
  cola onstage. Also lots of unwholesome cursing and nudity occurred. This way 
  I knew that no matter how tempting the cash was, they'd never do business with 
  me again. <br />
  If you want some little obedient slave content provider, then fine. But I think 
  most musicians don't want to be responsible for your clean-cut, wholesome, all-American, 
  sugar corrosive cancer-causing, all white people, no women allowed sodapop images. 
  <br />
  Nor, on the converse, do we want to be responsible for your vice-inducing, liver-rotting, 
  child-labor-law-violating, all white people, no-women-allowed booze images. 
  <br />
  So as a defiant moody artist worth my salt, I've got to think of something else. 
  Tampax, maybe. <br />
  Money <br />
  As a user, I love Napster. It carries some risk. I hear idealistic business 
  people talk about how people that are musicians would be musicians no matter 
  what and that we're already doing it for free, so what about copyright? <br />
  Please. It's incredibly easy not to be a musician. It's always a struggle and 
  a dangerous career choice. We are motivated by passion and by money. <br />
  That's not a dirty little secret. It's a fact. Take away the incentive for major 
  or minor financial reward and you dilute the pool of musicians. I am not saying 
  that only pure artists will survive. Like a few of the more utopian people who 
  discuss this, I don't want just pure artists to survive. <br />
  Where would we all be without the trash? We need the trash to cover up our national 
  depression. The utopians also say that because in their minds &quot;pure&quot; 
  artists are all Ani DiFranco and don't demand a lot of money. Why are the utopians 
  all entertainment lawyers and major label workers anyway? I demand a lot of 
  money if I do a big huge worthwhile job and millions of people like it, don't 
  kid yourself. In economic terms, you've got an industry that's loathsome and 
  outmoded, but when it works it creates some incentive and some efficiency even 
  though absolutely no one gets paid. <br />
  We suffer as a society and a culture when we don't pay the true value of goods 
  and services delivered. We create a lack of production. Less good music is recorded 
  if we remove the incentive to create it. <br />
  Music is intellectual property with full cash and opportunity costs required 
  to create, polish and record a finished product. If I invest money and time 
  into my business, I should be reasonably protected from the theft of my goods 
  and services. When the judgment came against MP3.com, the RIAA sought damages 
  of $150,000 for each major-label-&quot;owned&quot; musical track in MP3's database. 
  Multiply by 80,000 CDs, and MP3.com could owe the gatekeepers $120 billion. 
  <br />
  But what about the Plimsouls? Why can't MP3.com pay each artist a fixed amount 
  based on the number of their downloads? Why on earth should MP3.com pay $120 
  billion to four distribution companies, who in most cases won't have to pay 
  a nickel to the artists whose copyrights they've stolen through their system 
  of organized theft? <br />
  It's a ridiculous judgment. I believe if evidence had been entered that ultimately 
  it's just shuffling big cash around two or three corporations, I can only pray 
  that the judge in the MP3.com case would have seen the RIAA's case for the joke 
  that it was. <br />
  I'd rather work out a deal with MP3.com myself, and force them to be artist-friendly, 
  instead of being laughed at and having my money hidden by a major label as they 
  sell my records out the back door, behind everyone's back. <br />
  How dare they behave in such a horrified manner in regards to copyright law 
  when their entire industry is based on piracy? When Mister Label Head Guy, whom 
  my lawyer yelled at me not to name, got caught last year selling millions of 
  &quot;cleans&quot; out the back door. &quot;Cleans&quot; being the records that 
  aren't for marketing but are to be sold. Who the fuck is this guy? He wants 
  to save a little cash so he fucks the artist and goes home? Do they fire him? 
  Does Chuck Phillips of the LA Times say anything? No way! This guy's a source! 
  He throws awesome dinner parties! Why fuck with the status quo? Let's pick on 
  Lars Ulrich instead because he brought up an interesting point! <br />
  Conclusion <br />
  I'm looking for people to help connect me to more fans, because I believe fans 
  will leave a tip based on the enjoyment and service I provide. I'm not scared 
  of them getting a preview. It really is going to be a global village where a 
  billion people have access to one artist and a billion people can leave a tip 
  if they want to. <br />
  It's a radical democratization. Every artist has access to every fan and every 
  fan has access to every artist, and the people who direct fans to those artists. 
  People that give advice and technical value are the people we need. People crowding 
  the distribution pipe and trying to ignore fans and artists have no value. This 
  is a perfect system. <br />
  If you're going to start a company that deals with musicians, please do it because 
  you like music. Offer some control and equity to the artists and try to give 
  us some creative guidance. If music and art and passion are important to you, 
  there are hundreds of artists who are ready to rewrite the rules. <br />
  In the last few years, business pulled our culture away from the idea that music 
  is important and emotional and sacred. But new technology has brought a real 
  opportunity for change; we can break down the old system and give musicians 
  real freedom and choice. <br />
  A great writer named Neal Stephenson said that America does four things better 
  than any other country in the world: rock music, movies, software and high-speed 
  pizza delivery. All of these are sacred American art forms. Let's return to 
  our purity and our idealism while we have this shot. <br />
  Warren Beatty once said: &quot;The greatest gift God gives us is to enjoy the 
  sound of our own voice. And the second greatest gift is to get somebody to listen 
  to it.&quot; <br />
  And for that, I humbly thank you. </div>
