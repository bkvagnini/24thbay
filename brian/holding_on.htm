<b>"Holding On"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 4/23/1993<br>

	For Andrea</i><br>

<br>

(V)	Ohh how I miss you<br>

	when you're not around<br>

	my whole world goes crazy<br>

	and turns upside down<br>

<br>

(C)	and when I see you in my dreams<br>

	holding on so tightly<br>

<br>



	I just ask myself why<br>

	Why do we say goodbye?<br>

<br>



(V)	Ohh how I love you<br>

	that smile in your eyes<br>

	the hidden laughter<br>

	makes me realize<br>

	<br>

(C)	Cause when I see us in my dreams<br>

	holding on so tightly<br>

	

	I just might realize<br>

	I'd rather say ......."goodnight"<br>

<br><br>

	Solo<br>

<br>

(C)	Cause when I see us in my dreams<br>

	Holding on so tightly<br>

	<br>

	I just now realized<br>

	We'll never say..........<br>

		"Goodbye"<br>

Written for my ex-fiance. She had complained that we had been dating for six months and that I had not written a song for her. The next day I penned this out. Some songs are written with a tiny bit of inspiration and then you have to wrestle with the rest of it, while some songs just write themselves. This song is the latter of the two...
