<b>"Darlena"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini and Gregory Bryson (c) 1989</i><br>

<br><br>

(I)	G G   A   A   C    C  D   D :||<br>

<br>

(C)	Darlena<br>

	Light of my life<br>

	An angel<br>

	Shining so bright<br>

<br>

(V) 	When I have fallen down<br>

	and feel so alone<br>

	You come on by<br>

	and make me feel strong<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

<br>

(V)	I'm at ease<br>

	when you're around<br>

	You chase away bad things<br>

	that make me feel down<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>



<br><br>

	(I)<br>

<br>

	(S)<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

<br>

(V)	When I think about you<br>

	I feel so great<br>

	All your love and sunshine<br>

	just penetrate<br>

		Darlena<br>

<br>

(V)	When I'm without you<br>

	I feel so down<br>

	I need a shot of your love<br>

	to bring me around<br>

<br>

	(C) 2x<br>

This was written for a girl named (gasp!!) Darlena, who I worked with and had a HUGE crush on...go figure...Greg Bryson suggested a change in the musical arrangement which made it sound so much better, hence the credit
