  <h1><b>"Behind Closed Doors"</b><br />
    <i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 1989</i><br />
    <br />
    (V) Little Johnny came home<br />
    and he slammed the door<br />
    He woke up Daddy and they couldn't<br />
    take no more<br />
    <br />
    (B) Blackened Eye, Broken Ribs<br />
    Bleeding gums and bleeding lips<br />
    little Johnny is bruised<br />
    badly beaten, abused<br />
    <br />
    (C) Behind Closed Doors<br />
    Behind Closed Doors<br />
    <br />
    (V) No one knows what goes on<br />
    In a place calle home<br />
    No one knows except<br />
    the victim<br />
    <br />
    All he did was make noise<br />
    Where no one was in sight<br />
    All he did was cry<br />
    throughout the night<br />
    <br />
    (C)<br />
    Behind Closed Doors<br />

    bleeding gums and bleedibg lips<br />
    another victim is bruised<br />
    and it could be you<br />

  I was sitting at a friend's house, when the phone rang. In the course of her 
  conversation, she had mentioned a book report that she was working on, with 
  the subject being child abuse and one of the chapters titled "Behind Closed 
  Doors". I immediately grabbed a scrap of paper and started writing this song...
