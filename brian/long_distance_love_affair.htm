<b>"Long Distance Love Affair"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 1987</i><br>

<br>

(C)	It's a long distance love affair<br>

	and it's too many numbers to dial for my lover<br>

	It's a long distance love affair<br>

	and I can't handle it no more<br>

<br>

(V)	I never get to see her<br>

	I never get to touch her<br>

	I never can <br>

	just drop by anymore<br>

<br>

	She's never there for me<br>

	and that's plain to see<br>

	I do not have<br>

	a shoulder to cry on<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

<br>

(V)	She's never there for me<br>

	the mailman's the only one<br>

	she ever sees<br>

	And he's not as good as me<br>

	he's not as<br>

	understanding<br>

<br>

(B)	But things have changed<br>

	as times gone by<br>

	and I don't know if<br>

	I still feel the same<br>

	You must understand<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

My girlfriend had moved to Key West, Florida from Pensacola, Florida, which doesn't seem that bad, until you look at a map of Florida. They are practically at opposite ends of the state, which feels like opposite ends of the Earth. We decided a few weeks later that it wouldn't work long distance, and so was born this song.
