<b>"The Last Time"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (C) 1989</i><br>

<br>

(V) 	Your long golden hair<br>

	Twinkling eyes<br>

	and your face<br>

	You take me away<br>

<br>

	Ray of sunshine<br>

	shining from your face; what can I say<br>

	you melt my heart<br>

	all the way<br>

<br>

(C)	and we will miss you, honey<br>

	we will miss you like the sun<br>

	that shines from your face<br>

	everyday<br>

<br><br>

	(S)<br>

<br>

(V)	that big, flashy smile<br>

	the sweet innocence<br>

	that radiates<br>

	from your face<br>

	<br>

	those beautiful eyes<br>

	just can't disguise<br>

	the radiance<br>

	of your heart<br>

<br>

	(C) 2x<br>

<br>

	and we will miss you<br>

We were coming back from a band trip and this girl was leaving...It was her last day at the school, as she was transferring to another school. The band was passing around a card and instead of a goodbye greeting, I jotted down the first two paragraphs. I finished the song later while in Korea...
