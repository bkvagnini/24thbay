<b>"It Must Be Love"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 1986</i><br>

<br>

(V)	When I wrap my arms around you<br>

	I feel something inside<br>

	I don't know what it is yet<br>

	but it's something that I just can't hide<br>

<br>

(C)	It must be love<br>

	It must be love , nothing else<br>

	It's gotta be love<br>

	It's gotta be love, what else?<br>

<br>

(V)	When I see you<br>

	My heart melts<br>

	And I run into things<br>

	Cause I see nothing else<br>

	The problem's not my eyes<br>

	It's just my heart<br>

	Cause when I'm with you<br>

	You can't tear me apart<br>

<br>

(V)	When I see you talking<br>

	to another guy<br>

	I get so jealous<br>

	That I go skyhigh<br>

	The problem's not my mind<br>

	It's just my heart<br>

	cause when I see you<br>

	I just melt apart<br>

<br><br>

	(S)<br>

	<br>

(V)	When I see you walking down the street<br>

	I trip over my own two feet<br>

	Running to you<br>

	The woman that I gave my heart to<br>

	You're talking to a friend<br>

	and I come up interrupting<br>

	He can't be seen with you<br>

	I'm the only one you can talk to<br>

<br>

	(B)<br>

<br>

(V)	I know that I'm jealous<br>

	but I don't want others gettin' overzealous<br>

	getting close to you<br>

	I'm the only one you belong to<br>

<br>

	(C) 2x<br>

This was the very first song I ever wrote, with lyrics. It's not the greatest, but it was the first effort...
