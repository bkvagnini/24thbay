<b>"Leper's Circle"</b><br>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 2/29/1988</i><br>

<br>

(V)	I passed you in the hall<br>

	You didn't say "hi"<br>

	used to be good friends and all<br>

	now I wonder why<br>

<br>

(B)	we drifted apart<br>

	don't know why<br>

	tore my heart<br>

	don't know why<br>

<br>

(C)	Am I part<br>

	of the leper's circle<br>

	what did I do <br>

	to deserve this<br>

	I tried everything<br>

	I could<br>

	Didn't even get a kiss<br>

<br>

(V)	Passed you on the way to class<br>

	stuck your nose in the air<br>

	you really hurt my feeling, you know<br>

	like I wasn't even there<br>

	Don't know how you feel about me<br>

	or how I feel about you<br>

	I can't tell what you mean to me<br>

	My heart's like a zoo<br>

<br>

	(B)<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

	(S)- use chorus chord changes<br>

<br>

	(C)<br>

<br>

	repeat first verse<br>

I had broken up with this girl and normally I remain on pretty good terms with ex-girlfriends. This was not one of those times....
