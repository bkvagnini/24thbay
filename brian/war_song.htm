I was in Korea, a mere 18 years old and away from home for the first time in my life. I was feeling very depressed and just wrote my thoughts out on paper. I ended up with twelve sentences. Five years later, I'm in a graphic design class and have to abstractly illustrate a twelve sentence story. This song is the result. I spent an hour and a half on the project and siz hours recording the song. Needless to say, at the critique, i received an A+ for the project. Here is some of the art associated with the song. It was composited out of five different photographs. My thanks go out to the photographers that I sampled from for this image.
