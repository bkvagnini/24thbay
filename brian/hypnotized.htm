<b>"Hypnotized"<br></b>

<i>by Brian K. Vagnini (c) 1986</i>

<br><br>

	(Drum Intro)<br><br>



(You do anything you're told)<br>

(C1)<br>	when you're hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

	when you're hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

<br>

(V)<br>	They can make you act like a chicken<br>

	Stand on your head and recite Charles Dickens<br>

	They can make you act like a fool<br>

	when you jump into that swimming pool<br>



(C2)<br>	when you're hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

	when you're hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

	you're hypnotized<br>

	you do anything you're told<br>

	when you're hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

<br>

(V)<br>	They can make you act like a pig<br>

	they can make you put on a green and purple wig<br>

	They can make you into a star<br>

	but I doubt that you'll go very far<br>

	<br>

	They can take advantage of you<br>

	they can make you look<br>

	like a fool<br>

	You will bend in to their wishes<br>

	and give out free on dollar kisses<br>

<br>

	(C2)<br>

<br>

(V)<br>	They can make act like you're drunk<br>

	they can make you act ...like a skunk<br>

	and you'll go around all day<br>

	sayin' and shoutin' "pardon me"<br>

<br>

	(S)<br>

<br>

	(C2)<br>

	<br>

	hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

	when you're hypnotized<br>

	you do anything you're told<br>

	when you're hypnotized<br>

	and you're not in control<br>

<br>

	HYPNOTIZED!<br>
