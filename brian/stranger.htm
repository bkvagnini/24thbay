	<i>by Brian K. Vagnini<br>

	finished 12/15/02 (for Cherise)</i><br>

<br>

			A      Bm<br>

(V)	There was a stranger<br>

	but I knew her well<br>

	She used to come round all the time<br>

	and now it's just for thrills<br>

<br>

		G       A         D   C<br>

(C)	But I like it anyway      <br>

	I only wish that she would stay<br>

<br>

(V) 	She was a good friend<br>

	but I wanted more<br>

	couldn't decide on me on not<br>

	it's like a yo-yo<br>

<br>

	She would come round all the time<br>

	and we would have a ball<br>

	the next week she would disappear<br>

	She won't be gone for long<br>

<br>

(C)	But I like it anyway<br>

	I only wish that she would stay<br>

	I need to know how she feels<br>

	are her feelings for me real?<br>

<br><br>

	SOLO (V and C)<br>

<br>

(V)	There was a stranger<br>

	and I knew her well<br>

	but she has gone out of my life<br>

	I hope that all is well<br>

<br>

	I often wonder how she is<br>

	I should give her a call<br>

	We could talk about old times<br>

	and we would have a ball<br>

<br>

(C)	But I like it anyway<br>

	I only wish that she'd stayed<br>

	God only knows how it wouldv'e been<br>

	at least we are still friends<br>

<br>

	(V  2x)<br>

<br>

	There was a stranger<br>

	and I knew her well<br>

Written for Cherise, who was absolutely beautiful. However, she was a bit younger than I was and she decided to go back to her abusive boyfriend that I had rescued her from in the first place. Hence the yo-yo reference. After she decided to go back to him, my feelings for her changed. I don't much care for being used, and I could see that it might have gone that way.
