	<b>Puppeteer</b><br>

	<i>by Brian K. Vagnini

	(c) 5 June, 1991<br>

	inspired by Mercy</i><br>

	(upbeat rock groove)<br>

<br><br>



   D                            C        Am<br>

(v)who's the servant, who's the master<br>

does anyone know, or do they care?<br>

& does this knowledge spell disaster<br>

for me<br>

<br>

& I don't really know the answer<br>

but we'll see as time goes by<br>

then my heart would soar a million miles<br>

for you<br>

<br><br>



    Em               D<br>

(c) Who is the puppeteer<br>

                                 C         D    <br> 

do you know who's strings you're pulled by<br>

and when they do appear<br>

shears in hand<br>

cutting the strings<br>

let go of the things<br>

that connect me to you<br>

<br>

(v) who's the servant, who's the master<br>

the lines are not so clearly drawn<br>

& does it matter any more for me<br>

I think not  I've lost the war<br>

<br><br>



    G<br>

(B) Jealousy<br>

       F<br>

    hypocrisy<br>

              D<br>

    they're a part of me<br>

                  C<br>

    for life with you<br>

<br>

    Don't understand<br>

    how clothes make the man<br>

    what he is<br>

    & and what he's not<br>

<br><br>

(4 bar drum break)<br>

<br>

(V) who's the servant, who's the master<br>

the picture's clear and bright as day<br>

& everyone here says that you are whipped<br>

by that cat, and that's a fact<br>

<br>

I don't really care about you<br>

since the way you treated me<br>

was worse than any dog I've ever seen<br>

in the shelter, life unforeseen<br>

<br>

(c) 2x<br>

This was written about a woman named Mercy, who I was on tour with. I liked her and when I explained how I felt, she told me that she doesn't date people that she works with. Fair enough. However, she soon took a liking to the guitar player and began seeing him. This song starts off with my feelings and ends with her being in control (not of me but of him, you see...). I remember telling my roommate towards the end of the tour, as he was hauling not only his bags, but hers as well (kinda looked like a pack mule) "That would've been me!" Sometimes things work out for the best. Interesting postscript...They ended up marrying each other a short time later and to my knowledge, they are still married as of 2002. Strange the way things work out...
